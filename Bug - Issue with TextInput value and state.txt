NOTE:TextInput requires string value.Value of TextInput is the components
state,but I can't do manipulations with string

Fisrt option:
Try to turn state into string and pass it to TextInput value with some kind
of stringify

NOTE:I tryed something else,its didn't help me with whole bug,but it solve at
least one problem,my players input value is now binded

NOTE:So now when I click on the Count button The Bot changes his value too.
That means that my code recognise the state!For now I must fix result.

NOTE:For now we have 2 bugy methods in Body showresult() and clickCount(),
winningStrategy() is working well.

	SUBBUG:I find out that I cant use more than one method in button,so I
	must wrap it in one method
