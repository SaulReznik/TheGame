WHAT IS THE PROBLEM:when I click the button my algorithm are correctly
calculate the bot-s input value,but not correct the result-s value,he just
add players value and just 1

NOTE:so I fix the click counter,now I find out that when I click the first time
in result my algorithm just add the value of the player,in second click it adds
the bots value to result,after second click it adds both values at once.

	FIRST OPTION:try to find the bug in the conditions block of allStuff():
	COME BACK IN CASE OF COLLAPSE OF SECOND OPTION 

	SECOND OPTION:try do players iput with slider

NOTE:The bug is fixed,see "Bug - Issue with TextInput value and state
