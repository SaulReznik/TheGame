NOTE:The bug is in the all functions that I create,currently in
1.showResult
2.clickCount
3.winningStrategy

NOTE:I suspect that it related with this.setState,it trys too update the state
constantly and becomes a INFINITE LOOP!

What can I do with that?

First option:
bind all the functions - NOT WORKED

NOTE:In my researches I find that it also can be a component lifecycle issue,
in case of state or props changing the component automatically updates,I want
to try find the solution in lifecycle methods for now.

Second oprion:
Try to find the solution in lifecycle methods - NOT FOUNDED

NOTE:I tryed to alert the state when I clicked the Count button,but it works
when I click the Start The Game Button,so it means that the program understands
that onPress is common atribute or something like this,so we must fix this


	SUBBUG:Fix the onPress bug that I note above
	
	First option:
	bind the function that you call in onPress - WORKED!

Main bug also fixed,Congratulations!
